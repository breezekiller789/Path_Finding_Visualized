## Getting Started

* First two mouse click to add Source node, End node
* Mouse left click to add walls
* Mouse right click to remove nodes
* Press d to use DFS Algorithm
* Press b to use BFS Algorithm
* Press a to use A* Algorithm
* Press j to use Dijkstra Algorithm
* Press SPACE to pause the algorithm
* Press c to clear board
* Press r to clear board but leave walls, start, end nodes

### Prerequisites

Virtual environments are recommended

```
pip install virtualenv
```

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/breezekiller789/Path_Finding_Visualized.git
```
```
cd Path_Finding_Visualized
```
```
virtualenv venv
```
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Running the program

```
python Path_Finding_Visualized.py
```

### Make your own board

You can modify the board size by changing the ROW variable inside main(), enjoy:))
