## Getting Started

* Press d to use DFS Algorithm
* Press b to use BFS Algorithm
* Press a to use A* Algorithm
* Press SPACE to pause the program
* Press c to clear board

### Prerequisites

Virtual environments are recommended

```
pip install virtualenv
```

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/breezekiller789/Path_Finding_Visualized.git
```
```
cd Path_Finding_Visualized
```
```
virtualenv venv
```
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Running the program

```
python Path_Finding_Visualized.py
```

### Make your own board

You can modify the board size by changing the ROW variable inside main()
